== Conclusion

If you've made it through all ten chapters, you now have a solid
understanding of where Proxmox deployments commonly go wrong - and more
importantly, how to avoid those pitfalls in your own environment.

Let's step back and look at the bigger picture.

=== The Common Thread

Reading through these mistakes, you might notice a pattern. Very few of
them are about Proxmox being broken or badly designed. Instead, they're
about mismatched expectations, outdated assumptions, and the gap between
"`technically possible`" and "`actually advisable.`"

ZFS works with limited RAM - it just doesn't work well. RAIDZ provides
redundancy - just not the kind of performance VMs need. Docker runs on
the Proxmox host - until it conflicts with something important. HA can
be enabled on two nodes - it just won't actually provide high
availability.

The recurring theme is that Proxmox gives you tremendous flexibility,
and with that flexibility comes the responsibility to understand the
implications of your choices. The tool won't stop you from doing things
that seem reasonable but lead to problems. That's not a flaw; it's the
nature of powerful, flexible software.

=== Principles Over Checklists

Rather than memorizing specific rules, internalize the principles behind
them:

*Understand your resource requirements.* Whether it's RAM for ZFS, nodes
for quorum, or IOPS for VM storage, know what your chosen technology
actually needs - not what forum posts vaguely suggest.

*Separate concerns cleanly.* Hypervisor versus applications. VM storage
versus backup storage. Infrastructure layer versus application layer.
Clear boundaries make systems easier to understand, maintain, and
troubleshoot.

*Plan for failure.* Backups that aren't tested aren't backups. HA that
can't achieve quorum isn't highly available. Monitoring that doesn't
alert you isn't monitoring. Think through what happens when things go
wrong, not just when they go right.

*Keep it simple until you need complexity.* Local-LVM might be enough. A
single node might be enough. Basic vzdump backups might be enough. Add
complexity when you have concrete requirements that demand it, not
because it seems more professional.

*Maintain visibility.* You can't manage what you can't see. Monitoring,
logging, regular health checks - these aren't optional extras for
serious environments. They're how you know whether your infrastructure
is healthy before users start complaining.

=== Your Environment Is Unique

This guide provides general recommendations, but your specific situation
might call for different choices. A homelab running non-critical
workloads has different requirements than a production cluster serving
paying customers. A single-node setup doesn't need to worry about
migration compatibility. An environment with excellent backups can
tolerate more risk in other areas.

Use the principles from this guide to evaluate your own requirements and
constraints. The goal isn't to implement every recommendation blindly -
it's to make informed decisions that match your actual needs.

=== Continuous Improvement

A well-running Proxmox environment isn't a destination; it's an ongoing
practice. Technology evolves. Your workloads change. New features become
available while old assumptions become outdated.

Schedule periodic reviews of your infrastructure. Are your backups still
covering everything important? Has your storage grown beyond what your
original RAM allocation supports? Are there new Proxmox features that
would improve your setup? Is your monitoring still catching what
matters?

The administrators who avoid disasters aren't the ones who set things up
perfectly once - they're the ones who pay attention continuously and
address small issues before they become big ones.

=== Final Thoughts

Proxmox VE is genuinely excellent software that powers countless
reliable environments around the world. When things go wrong, the cause
is usually human decisions rather than software defects. That's actually
good news: it means you have control over your outcomes.

Build your environment thoughtfully. Monitor it diligently. Back it up
religiously. Keep learning as the technology evolves.

And the next time you're tempted to take a shortcut - to skip the backup
test, to install just one more service on the host, to enable HA on a
two-node cluster because surely it'll be fine - remember that future you
is the one who'll deal with the consequences.

Be kind to future you.

Good luck with your Proxmox deployments.
