== Introduction

Proxmox VE has become one of the most popular virtualization platforms
for good reason. It's powerful, flexible, open source, and capable of
running everything from a small homelab to serious production
infrastructure. The web interface is intuitive, the documentation is
solid, and the community is active and helpful.

And yet, Proxmox environments fail. VMs become sluggish for no apparent
reason. Clusters split-brain during maintenance windows. Backups turn
out to be useless when you actually need them. Storage pools degrade
silently until a second disk failure turns inconvenience into
catastrophe.

These failures rarely stem from bugs in Proxmox itself. Instead, they
grow from decisions made during setup and configuration - decisions that
seemed reasonable at the time but were based on incomplete
understanding, outdated advice, or assumptions that didn't match
reality. The gap between "`it works`" and "`it works reliably`" is
filled with hard-won knowledge that most of us acquire the painful way:
by experiencing failures firsthand.

This guide exists to help you skip some of that pain.

=== Who This Guide Is For

Whether you're running a homelab in your basement, managing
infrastructure for a small business, or consulting for clients who need
reliable virtualization, this guide addresses the mistakes that matter
in your world. We're not talking about exotic edge cases or theoretical
concerns - we're talking about the issues that actually break systems
and ruin weekends.

The assumed baseline is basic familiarity with Proxmox and Linux
administration. You don't need to be an expert, but you should be
comfortable with the command line and understand what terms like VM,
container, and storage pool mean. If you've set up Proxmox at least once
and gotten it running, you're ready for this material.

=== What You'll Learn

This guide covers ten common mistakes, each explored in enough depth to
understand not just what to do, but why it matters:

*Storage fundamentals* - why ZFS needs more RAM than you think, why the
ECC debate is mostly noise, and why RAIDZ might be the wrong choice for
your VM workloads.

*Configuration decisions* - understanding when Local-LVM makes sense
again, why the "`host`" CPU type can sabotage your cluster, and what
High Availability actually requires to function.

*Operational practices* - building a backup strategy that actually
protects you, keeping Docker off your hypervisor, implementing
monitoring that catches problems early, and maintaining the discipline
to keep your Proxmox host clean.

Each chapter stands on its own, so feel free to jump to the topics most
relevant to your situation. That said, reading through sequentially will
give you a coherent picture of what a well-designed Proxmox environment
looks like and why each piece matters.

=== A Note on Advice

Technology advice ages poorly. What was best practice five years ago
might be outdated today, and what's current now will eventually be
superseded. Proxmox itself evolves - features that were problematic in
version 7 might work flawlessly in version 9.

This guide reflects the state of Proxmox VE as of 2025, with particular
attention to changes in recent versions. Where historical context
matters - like the improvements to Local-LVM snapshots in PVE 9 - we'll
note it explicitly. But always verify that advice still applies to your
specific version before implementing changes in production.

More importantly, understand the reasoning behind each recommendation.
Technology changes, but the underlying principles - defense in depth,
separation of concerns, knowing your failure modes - remain constant. If
you understand why a practice is recommended, you'll be able to adapt
when circumstances differ from what any guide anticipates.

=== Disclaimer

The material in this book is guidance, not a guarantee. Every
environment is different; you are responsible for validating changes in
your own lab before production and for ensuring compliance with your
organization's policies and applicable laws.

*No warranties.* All advice is provided "as is" without warranty of any
kind. Apply it at your own risk.

*Test first.* Reproduce steps in a non-production lab, make and verify
backups, and have rollback plans before touching live systems.

*Security and compliance.* Verify that any suggested configuration meets
your security baselines, logging/monitoring requirements, and regulatory
obligations (e.g., data protection, industry standards).

*Vendor documentation prevails.* Always cross-check against current
Proxmox, distro, firmware, and hardware vendor documentation; if they
conflict, follow the vendor.

*Get professional help when needed.* For business-critical workloads,
engage qualified professionals and follow formal change-management.

=== Let's Begin

Proxmox is capable of remarkable reliability when configured
thoughtfully. The difference between an environment that runs smoothly
for years and one that generates constant firefighting often comes down
to decisions made during initial setup - decisions you might not realize
were wrong until much later.

The goal of this guide is to help you make better decisions from the
start, or to recognize and correct problematic patterns in existing
environments before they cause serious trouble.

Let's look at the first mistake: underestimating what ZFS really needs
to run well.
